After more than 7 years I am closing my first big career chapter and leave [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) to join a small Silicon Valley startup and two founders that brought me to Sauce in the first place. I can't say enough how grateful I am to see this company growing from 70 to more than 540 people and 4 aquisitions.

_As my first "offical" blog post I would love to take the time to recap this journey. It will be probably a bit long and rather non technical. If you like to read along I will have some learnings for you I feel can help everyone in their career._

I remember very vividly how everything started. In 2013 I participated at my first conference ever called [JSConf EU](https://2013.jsconf.eu/). As a student who started to get into the tech scene this was like heaven to me. Seeing people, from whom I've been learning so much, like [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), [Domenic Denicola](https://twitter.com/domenic) or [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) on stage or at the delicious breakfast menu felt like hanging out at a music festival but backstage. I also happen to see [Adam Christian](https://twitter.com/admc) from Sauce Labs there who has been authoring an popular open source project called [WD](https://github.com/admc/wd) at that time. As I was working already on [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) back then, I wanted to take the chance to speak to Adam to exchange ideas and get to know him. However, that was not an easy undertaking as I felt way too shy for this. I grew up on the country side in the middle of Germany and didn't expect that someone from San Francisco would be interested to talk to me. With some personal encouragement and a slight push from friends that were with me I caught him in the hall way and it turns out he was the nicest person on earth. I learned that whoever you see on conferences you want to talk to, don't be shy, have the courage - people are nice to you! This bit of couragement got me to intern at Sauce Labs, what a life changing opportunity.

I can't emphasize this enough: I grew up on the country side and moving to Berlin was already such a big step. In 2014 I found myself on an airplane San Francisco bound, my first trip to a different continent. I remember that I had so many "What the f***" moments during these 3 months internship. My biggest one was right at the first day at Sauce, which was my birthday and also the first day of a conference, called JavaOne, apparently one of the biggest conference events in the industry. They had all of Treasure Island and whole street lanes blocked just for this event. I was only able to go because someone from Sauce couldn't make it and I was the last intern in the office. When I was in front of the stage seeing Aerosmith and Macklemore live I really wasn't sure if this was real.

During my internship and my following years as contractor and full time employee in Berlin I went through almost all engineering teams Sauce Labs had. From a small web team that had to migrate a Python application to a more modern web stack (at that time) with Angular and Django, to founding and leading an Open Source Program Office. During all these years I continued my open source work on WebdriverIO which helped me to not only pick up technical skills but also understand our customer very well. WebdriverIO as automation tool was used by a lot of Sauce Labs customers and their feedback helped me envision new features which I was able to bring into the platform. I am very grateful that all my (project) manager believed in my vision, from [capturing HAR files and mock browser requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkWv-JIf4eo) using Chrome DevTools to testing the [performance of web applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP-j9uPPbt8) all just with WebDriver. As my interest into open source and open standards has grown, I build together a vision for a new team that should be responsible for how Sauce Labs not only consumes open source but also distributes it. That vision became the [Open Source Program Office](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/) which has been the last team I was delighted to work with.

Leaving a company, especially after spending such a long time working for it, is always hard. I've always been enjoying working for Sauce Labs and will never forget the time I spent with this company. At some point however you have to reflect what is best for you, your career and your professional development. Spending too much time in a certain environment can lead you to become less focused, concentrated and passionate on what you do. It is always good to throwing yourself into cold water every once in a while, starting at ActiveCove will be exactly that.

I will join [ActiveCove](https://www.activecove.com/) as founding engineer with team I know very well from the early days at Sauce. I will move from the browser and mobile automation space into a new environment that is focused on developer happiness. I will continue my current open source engagements as far as I can.
