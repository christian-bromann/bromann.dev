After more than 7 years I am closing my first big career chapter and leave [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) to join a small Silicon Valley startup. It has been a wild ride with a lot of moments I won't forget and I can't say it often enough how grateful I am to see this company growing from 70 to more than 540 people and 4 company acquisitions.

_In my first "official" blog post I would love to take the time to recap this journey. It will be probably a bit long and rather non technical. If you like to read along there will be some learnings for you that I feel can help anyone in their career. I hope you enjoy!_

I remember very vividly how everything started. In 2013 I participated my first conference ever, called [JSConf EU](https://2013.jsconf.eu/). As a student who started to get into the tech scene, this was like heaven to me. Having all the influential people that I've been following, like [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), [Domenic Denicola](https://twitter.com/domenic) or [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) were all on-site, on stage or sometimes directly next to me in the buffet line. It felt like hanging out at a music festival but backstage. One of those people was also [Adam Christian](https://twitter.com/admc), who was an engineer at Sauce Labs at that time and has been authoring a popular open source project called [WD](https://github.com/admc/wd). As I was already working on a similar project called [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) back then, I wanted to take the chance to speak, get to know him and exchange ideas about test automation in Node.js. That turned out to be more difficult that expected. My amount of respect and lack of self-confidence really challenged me to step out of my comfort zone. It turned out that he was the nicest person on earth and just within five minutes of talking he dragged me along and from one moment to another I was in a talking circle of everyone I looked up to. That taught me that everyone is just a human at the end of the day. So whoever you see on conferences that you want to talk to, don't be shy, have the courage - people will be nice to you! At the end of the night I got also introduced to his colleague [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sourishkrout) and the idea was born to start as an intern at Sauce Labs. This was the beginning of everything and all just thanks to a little push to get outside of your comfort zone.

If you don't know me, you should be aware that I grew up on the country side next to üêî and a bunch of cow üí©. Moving to Berlin was already such a big step for me. Then in 2014 I found myself on an airplane to San Francisco on an H1B visa. It my first trip to a different continent ever. I remember that I had so many "What the f***" moments during these 3 months internship. My biggest one was right at the first day at Sauce, which was my birthday and also the first day of a conference, called JavaOne, apparently one of the biggest conference events in the industry (at that time). They had all of Treasure Island and whole street lanes blocked just for this event. I was only able to go because someone from Sauce couldn't make it and I was the last intern in the office. Who would have thought that I would end up at a huge carnival for grown ups, where everything was free, including a live concert from Aerosmith and Macklemore live. I realized quickly how different the mentality was compared to Germany. "Work hard, play hard!" is what I often heard and it really resonated with. For the first time I worked with people that didn't just show up to work and earn one's living, they came to build something they were passionate about. I liked that a lot.

During my internship and my following years as contractor and full time employee in Berlin I went through almost all engineering teams Sauce Labs had. From a small web team that had to migrate a Python application to a more modern web stack (at that time) with Angular and Django, to founding and leading an Open Source Program Office. During all these years I continued my open source work on WebdriverIO which helped me to not only pick up technical skills but also understand our customer very well. It continued to grow over the years and as more people started using it the more feedback I was able to receive, which helped me to envision new product features which I was able to bring onto the platform. I am very grateful that so many people at Sauce Labs believed in my vision, from [capturing HAR files and mocking browser requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkWv-JIf4eo) using Chrome DevTools to testing the [performance of web applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP-j9uPPbt8) with WebDriver. As my interest in open source and open standards has grown, I build together a vision for a new team that should be responsible for how Sauce Labs not only consumes open source but also distributes it. That vision became the [Open Source Program Office](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/) which has been the last team I was delighted to work with. For many years I initiated my own teams which is probably not possible in every company but has shown me that if you have an idea and people that believe in it, you can have a big impact in a growing start-up.

Leaving a company, especially after spending such a long time working for it, is always hard. I've been enjoying working for Sauce Labs and will never forget the time I spent with this company. At some point however you have to reflect on what is best for you, your career and your professional development. Spending too much time in a certain environment can lead you to become less focused, concentrated and passionate on what you do. I can really recommend to read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/alexandracoding/status/1448349624939466753?s=21) from [@alexandracoding](https://twitter.com/alexandracoding) about this, it perfectly sums it up. At the end of the day it is always good to throw yourself into cold water every once in a while, starting at ActiveCove will be exactly that. While WebdriverIO and many other open source projects I've been maintaining over the last years won't play such an important role for my new employer, I will continue to work on them to the best of my abilities.

I will join [ActiveCove](https://www.activecove.com/) as founding engineer with Adam and Sebastian as founders. I am very excited that the two people that opened my first professional chapter, will also open the second one. I will move from the browser and mobile automation space into a new environment that is focused on building tools that help to increase developer happiness.
